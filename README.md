## Abstract
The declaration of covid-19 as a global pandemic caused a drastic market crash in the American economy during
March 2020 (Walker, 2021). We are trying to figure out if the amount of deaths and positive cases during the
pandemic would have any effect on a country’s economy. To achieve this goal, we are going to compare the main
index funds of our chosen countries, the United States of America and Hong Kong, to the amount of covid cases and
deaths of the respective countries. We chose index funds to represent the economy as they are usually made up of
60% of the market capitalization. At the start of the pandemic, the tech bubble seemed to have burst, recovery
seemed to be a long while away. As economic activities were halted in order to combat the pandemic, the number of
positive cases and deaths were on the rise. Which leads to the question, **is the recovery
of a country’s economy affected by the number of deaths or positive cases?**

## Datasets
COVID data collected from the COVID Tracking Project for USA and the Hong Kong government, containing date, cases, and deaths.

Stock market data from index funds S&P 500 and Hang Seng for USA and Hong Kong respectively, containing date and closing price.

## Resultes
For the discussion about the collected results and conclusions, please view the [project report](https://github.com/ivanfye/covid-market-correlation/blob/main/project_report.pdf) for more.
